# 🛠️ Synthron – Custom PC Recommendation Platform

**Synthron** is a full-stack web application that helps users intelligently build custom PC configurations based on their needs (gaming, editing, budget, etc.) using a combination of AI prompt parsing and real-time price scraping from trusted websites.

The system uses **React** for the frontend and **Django + Django REST Framework** on the backend, connected via REST APIs. It uses an **LLM (TinyLLaMA or LLaMA 3.2)** to interpret user prompts, and **Playwright** for dynamic scraping of part prices and availability.

> 🔍 Currently achieving **70–75% scraping predictability/accuracy**. Further improvements are planned.

## ⚙️ Backend – Django Setup

### 1. Clone and set up virtual environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-pc-builder.git
cd ai-pc-builder/backend

python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # Windows: env\Scripts\activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Create `.env` file:

```
SECRET_KEY=your_django_secret_key
DEBUG=True
DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/pcbuilder
```

### 3. Run migrations and start server:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```

### 📦 Backend Dependencies (`backend/requirements.txt`)

```
Django>=4.2
djangorestframework
python-dotenv
httpx
playwright
psycopg2-binary
```

To install Playwright browsers:

```bash
playwright install
```

---

## 🎨 Frontend – React Setup

### 1. Navigate to frontend directory:

```bash
cd ../frontend
```

### 2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run development server:

```bash
npm run start
```

## 🔗 How It Works

1. **User Input**: "I want a gaming PC under $1000 in Usa and i prefer an AMD build."
2. **LLM** parses intent, budget, and region.
3. Each **component agent** (CPU, GPU, RAM, etc.) activates.
4. Agents create **product-specific search queries**.
5. **Serper** fetches urls off the web.
6. **Playwright** scrapes trusted e-commerce websites.
7. Components are selected and ranked by:
   - 🔄 Stock availability
   - 💰 Lowest price
   - 🙋 User preference
8. The **result** is rendered on the frontend with prices and product links.

## ✅ Trusted Sites Scraped

- [Amazon](https://amazon.com)
- [Newegg](https://newegg.com)
- [Microcenter](https://microcenter.com)
- [Scan UK](https://scan.co.uk)
- And more…

> 🗑️ `ScrapeGraph` API was removed due to limited free-tier usage. All scraping is now handled with Playwright.

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

- 🛒 Scraping accuracy is 70–75% — dynamic rendering and anti-bot measures may impact results.
- ❌ Not all product queries yield valid results (fallback logic is used).
- 🌍 Currency and regional detection are still basic.

---

## 🔮 Roadmap

- 🧠 Improve scraping reliability via AI heuristics
- 🔌 Add PSU and case suggestions
- 💸 Integrate Amazon Affiliate tracking
- 📊 Admin dashboard for scraping diagnostics
- 🔐 OAuth login support (Google, GitHub)

---

🛠️ Currently improving LLM integration and scraping engine.
